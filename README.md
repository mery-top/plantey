## Inspiration 🌟
**"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."**  
– Theodore Roosevelt  

My inspiration for creating Plantey comes from the belief that we can make a difference by **caring for the environment with the resources we already have**. I’ve personally discovered that even a small garden, with plants specifically suited to our region and nurtured using what’s available to us, can have a meaningful impact. It’s this simple yet powerful idea that drives Plantey – small actions leading to big changes for a healthier planet.
